		<h1>CONNECTING <br />PRACTICE & RESEARCH</h1>
			<img src="/images/broaderimpacts/undeline.gif">
				<p>How can we best connect social science research with the practice of designing experiences and settings to advance the field of informal STEM learning? One strategy is through the process of developing a research agenda.</p>
                <p>There is a growing number of field-initiated research framework, agenda and roadmap projects that involve deep and sustained discussions among practitioners and researchers about the kinds of questions that will be best inform practice and build knowledge. These processes typically involve reviewing current literature, summarizing what is known and identifying gaps in evidence.</p>
                <p>The projects on this page are all at different points in their development trajectories, yet they overlap in instructive ways with regard to the processes they are employing and the categories of questions they are generating.

	<h3>Learning in Natural History Settings</h3>
		<p>Initiated by the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History, a community of natural history educators, designers and researchers has developed a learning research agenda intended to lead the field into the 21st Century. Importantly, the process has moved far beyond the Natural History Museum sector to include all environments and settings where people learn about nature and the role of collections in science.</p>

			<h3>Children's Museums</h3>
            <span style="font-size:14px">
            <p>The Association of Children’s Museums is leading a research agenda development process for the children’s museum field. Practitioners, researchers, and evaluators gathered in Washington D.C. in Fall 2013 for a two day brainstorming meeting which was followed up by a series of webinars intended to invite broader participation from the whole children’s museum field. The U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) recently re-funded ACM to continue its fruitful partnership with the University of Washington's Museology Graduate Program to advance the field's research agenda.</p>
            <p>Phase 2: Building a Practicing Research Network will begin to build the evidence about learning and children's museums called for by the agenda. The 3-year project will work to identify a cohort of children's museums to participate in a research network, identify potential research projects that will respond to the priorities in the research agenda, conduct research projects across multiple institutions in the research network, and aggregate data to share with the broader children's museum field.</p>
